          <p>After studying abroad in Berlin during the summer of 2019, I was inspired by the style of graphic design that I saw all across the city. In comparison to other European capitals, Berlin felt more chic and modern with straightforward blocks, sharp edges, and monotone color schemes. In particular, I wanted to emulate the brutalist-ic style that I not only saw in the design work and advertising in Berlin, but also the rising global trend of thick blocked letters and bold, outlined text.</p>
          <p>In the creation of this poster, I tried to play with the organization of information and the spacing of the blocks. I kept it relatively simple, using only one font throughout the piece. So, in order to make it more visually interesting but still cohesive, I tried many different iterations of positioning the black block in the background as well as the two white rectangular frams and the picture of the Brandenburg Gate. I also experimented with having the locations that I visited be positioned vertically along the top right side, which I thought made the page look a bit more interesting and filled up the whitespace nicely.</p>
