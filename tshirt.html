          <p>This is a graphic that I created that I also actually got to screenprint onto T-shirts for the first time! Keeping in mind the fact that this would be screenprinted (and thus the design couldn't be too detailed), I wanted to do a simple but blocky design that would show up well on a shirt. Because I hail from Colorado and I've done my fair share of wilderness exploration and adventuring, I wanted to create a piece that would honor the majesty of the Rockies but also look at nature from a different perspective.</p>
          <img class="gmimg" src="tshirtdraft.jpg" width=50% height=auto alt="tshirtdraft">
          <p>I really wanted to play around with the juxtaposition of nature and its freedom and fluid compared to shapes and geometry which has more structure and definition.</p>
